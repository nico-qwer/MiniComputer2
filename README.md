# MiniComputer2
The 2.0 version of my unfinished MiniComputer program
Using C# and .NET

## Tree like directory system:
You can create directories inside directories forever

## Image system:
Use hex numbers to show a pixel color
New line means new row of pixels
You can use spaces as much as you like between numbers
See ConsoleColors.txt for all colors available and their hex number

## Save files:
On boot up, chose the save file to load
Save all currently active files and directories
